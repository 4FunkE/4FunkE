### Hi there, I'm Emily Rose Funk, aka FunkE! 👋

🌄 Exploring nature, 🏋️‍♀️ weightlifting, and 🍏 nutrition are my side passions.

🚀 I'm diving into the world of Full Stack Development to craft web apps, mobile apps, and websites using the MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js).

💼 As an Art and Design Education graduate from Pratt Institute, I've honed my teaching, mentoring, and instructional skills. Now, I'm applying those skills to the world of coding.

🤝 I'm open to collaborations to learn and grow in the web development realm. Let's build something amazing!
